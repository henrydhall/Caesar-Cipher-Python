# Caesar-Cipher-Python

Text to encrypt: whatever you want to encrypt. Use quotes around.
Rotation: how many places you want to alphabet rotated.

## Decrypt Text
Not yet functioning. As a work around run the encrypter with the negative rotation that encrypted the text.

Currently only encrypting text from the commandline and printing it.

# Future Updates
Finish README
