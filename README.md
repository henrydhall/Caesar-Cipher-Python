# Caesar-Cipher-Python
Simple Caesar Cipher in Python to encrypt and decrypt text.

# Description
Using an alphabet of 100 printable characters, the program will accept input from the command line or text files to encrypt and print to the command line or output to a file.

# Usage
## Encrypt Text
In command line enter python CaesarEncrypter.py \[Text to encrypt] \[rotation]

Text to encrypt: whatever you want to encrypt. Use quotes around.

Rotation: how many places you want the alphabet rotated.

## Decrypt Text
Not yet functioning. As a work around run the encrypter with the negative rotation that encrypted the text.

# Features
Currently only encrypting text from the commandline and printing it.

# Future Updates
Finish README

Encrypt text and send to file.

All of the decrypter needs to be built.
